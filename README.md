Introducing our QR Menu application, designed to assist restaurants in creating QR code menus swiftly and efficiently. By quickly signing up on our website, you can create a customized menu for your restaurant and generate QR codes for your tables, ensuring a comfortable dining experience for your customers. Moreover, with this menu, you can accept orders and payments directly from your patrons, streamlining your order-taking process.

I developed this project using React and Django, crafting a user interface and experience that is simple, functional, and intuitive. Our aim was to provide restaurants with a seamless solution for digitizing menus and enhancing customer service.

<b>Key Features:</b>

* Easy Menu Creation: Create customized menus for your restaurant with ease.

* QR Code Generation: Generate QR codes for tables, allowing customers to access menus conveniently.

* Order and Payment Handling: Accept orders and payments directly through the application, reducing wait times and enhancing efficiency.
By leveraging React and Django, we have built a robust platform that caters to the specific needs of restaurants, offering a comprehensive solution for menu management and customer interaction.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
